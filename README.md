## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

* Node.js https://nodejs.org/

For a ready to use Docker environment with all prerequisites already installed
and prepared, you can check out the [Docker environment](#docker-environment)
section.

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-maps-noi.git
```

Change directory:

```bash
cd webcomp-maps-noi/
```

### Dependencies

Download all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build / Test

Build and start the project:

```bash
npm run start
```

The application will be served and can be accessed at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


## Deployment

To create the distributable files, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment server prerequisites

The server that hosts the image resources (svg, jpg, ...) must allow
cross-origin domain request. You can use an .htaccess file like:

```html
<FilesMatch "\.(svg)$">
	<IfModule mod_headers.c>
		Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
	</IfModule>
</FilesMatch>
```

## Folders
* dist - compiled and distributable file (*npm run build*)
* node_modules - installed node modules (*npm install*)
* work - production (*npm start*)

## Docker environment

For the project a Docker environment is already prepared and ready to use with
all necessary prerequisites.

These Docker containers are the same as used by the continuous integration
servers.

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally
on your machine.

### Dependenices

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "npm install"
```

### Start and stop the containers

Before start working you have to start the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

After finished working you can stop the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Running commands inside the container

When the containers are running, you can execute any command inside the
environment. Just replace the dots `...` in the following example with the
command you wish to execute:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "..."
```

Some examples are:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "npm run test"
```

## Edit-SVGs

These steps illustrate how to change the floorplans and icons svg using Adobe
Illustrator.

### Floorplans

* download the desired svg (e.g.
  https://stage.madeincima.it/noi-maps-svg-test/floors/a2-1.svg )
* open the svg with Adobe Illustrator
* in the "Levels" tab you'll find all the clickable rooms named after the
  `Beacon ID` code found in the Google Sheet **wrapped inside a group**

    #### Naming convention
    * beacon_id: `A2 1.10`
    illustrator level's name: `A2-1-10` *(building A2 , floor 1, room 10)*

    * beacon_id: `A2 1.10.C`
    illustrator level's name: `A2-1-10-C` *(building A2 , floor 1, room 10C)*

    * beacon_id: `A2-1.20`
    illustrator level's name: `A2--1-20` *(building A2 , floor -1, room 20)*

    * beacon_id: `A2-1.20.B`
    illustrator level's name: `A2--1-20-B` *(building A2 , floor -1, room 20B)*

    #### To summarize

    * **every dot (`.`) and every space (` `) must be replaced with a minus symbol (`-`)**
    `A2 1.10.C` -> `A2-1-10-C`

    * **every minus symbol (`-`) [negative floors] must be replaced with a double minus symbol (`--`)**
    `A2-1.20.B` -> `A1--1-20-B`

* edit the SVG as you like
* if you've added a clickable room **remember to wrap it in a group named after
  the naming convention accordingly with the beacon_id on the Google Sheet**
* Export the file using
    * File > Export > Export as
    * do NOT rename the file (leave the original file name)

    * #### SVG export options
        * **Styling**: Inline style
        * **Font**: SVG
        * **Image**: Embed
        * **Objects IDs**: Layer names
        * **Decimal**: 2
        * **Minify**: checked
        * **Responsive**: checked
* upload the SVG

### Icons
* just edit the desidered SVG and then re-upload it
* if possibile, use squared designs

### REUSE

This project is [REUSE](https://reuse.software) compliant, more information about the usage of REUSE in NOI Techpark repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-docs/wiki/Guidelines-for-developers-and-licenses#guidelines-for-contributors-and-new-developers).

Since the CI for this project checks for REUSE compliance you might find it useful to use a pre-commit hook checking for REUSE compliance locally. The [pre-commit-config](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file in the repository root is already configured to check for REUSE compliance with help of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) tool.

Install the tool by running:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
Then install the pre-commit hook via the config file by running:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
